Steps to follow before running the 'toxic_comment_classification.ipynb' file:

1) In your Google drive->My Drive : Create a new folder named 'data'.
2) Put the original dataset files here (train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv, etc)
4) On executing the cell it would try to connect to your google drive, follow the instructions and copy the Auth code that is displayed.
5) Enter the Auth code into the jupyter cell input prompt.

Note: Incase the folder name created in the google drive is different than 'data', then you will have to make change in the pd.read_csv command.
